                    Jenni offers Paediatric Occupational Therapy services to children in their own home or education setting (child-care, kindergarten or school). 
                    She enjoys working within a child’s environment as this helps children transfer skills learnt in therapy into their everyday life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jenni graduated from the University of South Australia, Adelaide in 1999 with a Bachelor of Applied Science – Occupational Therapy. 
                    Jenni began her career working with adults and quickly discovered her passion and joy for working with children. 
                    She has been working with children since 2006, and has a special interest in children’s development. 
                    The majority of her work has been with children from birth to 9 years of age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jenni has a holistic approach to working with children within the context of their home, child-care/school and community environment. 
                    She uses family centred principles in therapy and works to understand each child’s unique situation and goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jenni has a strong grounding in the development of fine motor, attention, sensory processing, hand writing and literacy skills in children. 
                    She uses pretend play skills to boost a child’s literacy and narrative skills. Jenni has a special interest in children with delayed self-care skills including toileting and feeding. 
                    She uses Stanley Greenspan’s Floortime principles in her therapy and enjoys working with children with social functioning difficulties such as autism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jenni has extensive experience working with school age children with attention and learning difficulties, supporting them to engage in the school curriculum to their best potential.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jenni has a commitment to her personal professional development and regularly attends relevant training. 
                    She participates in frequent individual clinical supervision, peer group supervision, journal clubs and multi-disciplinary in-services

                Jenni offers Paediatric Occupational Therapy services to children in their own home or education
                setting (child-care, kindergarten or school). She enjoys working within a child’s environment as
                this helps children transfer skills learnt in therapy into their everyday life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jenni graduated from the University of South Australia, Adelaide in 1999 with a Bachelor of Applied
                Science – Occupational Therapy. Jenni began her career working with adults and quickly discovered
                her passion and joy for working with children. She has been working with children since 2006, and
                has a special interest in children’s development. The majority of her work has been with children
                from birth to 9 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jenni has a holistic approach to working with children within the context of their home,
                child-care/school and community environment. She uses family centred principles in therapy and
                works to understand each child’s unique situation and goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jenni has a strong grounding in the development of fine motor, attention, sensory processing, hand
                writing and literacy skills in children. She uses pretend play skills to boost a child’s literacy
                and narrative skills. Jenni has a special interest in children with delayed self-care skills
                including toileting and feeding. She uses Stanley Greenspan’s Floortime principles in her therapy
                and enjoys working with children with social functioning difficulties such as autism.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jenni has extensive experience working with school age children with attention and learning
                difficulties, supporting them to engage in the school curriculum to their best potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jenni has a commitment to her personal professional development and regularly attends relevant
                training. She participates in frequent individual clinical supervision, peer group supervision,
                journal clubs and multi-disciplinary in-services.
